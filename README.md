# BIST-risk-adjusted-industry-performances

Evaluating the performance of investment indices is a crucial task for investors, as it allows them to make informed decisions about the allocation of their assets. In this article, we propose a framework for evaluating indices using a range of risk metrics, including Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Value at Risk, and Maximum drawdown. Evaluating indices through the use of various formulas that would measure sectoral risk metrics. The evaluation of the data gathered will be collected and studied to observe which equity and industry of BIST performs better through the use of various risk metrics. EIKON terminal will be used to withdraw 20 years of daily data required for risk metrics and evaluated through calculations from excel. 

Overall the study found that Sports, Telecommunication, Bank and Tourism performed worst generally in the metrics, while Basic Materials, Chemicals, Textile and National Technology performed better compared to the other. Study suggests that different sectors have different risks and these should be considered while creating an optimal portfolio. Also it can be mentioned that there is a correlation between performance of an industry in different risk metrics.
